# Todo Lister (Console-Todo)
Console Todo App written in C++
This straightforward and simple application generates a random id for each todo task when a new task is added, and you can use the same id to mark it as completed.
# Add a new Todo
Type `a` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to add a new Todo
# Mark a Todo as completed
Type `c` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>, and you will be prompted to enter the random generated `ID` shown beside the Todo you want to mark as completed. Type the `ID` and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> again. That's it.
